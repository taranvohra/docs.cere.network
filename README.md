# Introduction to Cere DDC

DDC is a decentralized data protocol built from the ground up for Web3, capable of powering a future of interoperable, privacy-preserving, and serverless data.

Itâ€™s a unique combination of storage and CDN clusters that improves the capabilities to reliably deliver content and makes dApp development a breeze.

Compared with other storage and CDN protocols, it gives full control, flexibility, and ease of integration to developers. It allows developers to choose geographical cluster locations, data replication levels, private/public data sharing and encryption.
